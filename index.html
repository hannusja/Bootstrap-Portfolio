             <p>I’ve lived a long life and did a lot of things. I have foreign Doctor of Medicine degree from Belarus. After graduation I worked at Human Anatomy Department of my university for three years, teaching human anatomy to medical students.</p> 
            <p>After relocation to US I worked in retail. As an Assistant Manager I was supporting business operations of a busy pet supplies store. Currently I am working as a Sterile Processing Tech at Aurora St. Luke's Medical Center. I really enjoy technical side of this job, working with equipment and instrumentation. </p>
            <p>And now I’ve joined UW-Extension Coding Bootcamp to fulfil my desire to do something new, more advanced and challenging. It’s totally new thing for me, so I can’t say for sure where my interests will be. Throughout multiple jobs I’ve noticed that while customer side of websites and apps is pretty cool, the apps that we use to do the job surprisingly lame and glitchy. So that might be something I’ll get myself into.</p>
